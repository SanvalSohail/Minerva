Reddit like SPA

Built out following features:
- Upvoting/Downvoting:

voting system allows users to upvote (thumbs up) or downvote (thumbs down) content, which determines the popularity of posts. This system acts like a democratic ranking mechanism where the community decides what’s good and what’s not.

- location based threads:

Site would use location data from threads and your session to display relevent threads to you.

- Comments & Threads:

Posts can be commented on, and those comments can also be upvoted or downvoted. Comments form "threads," and some of them can become very long, sometimes leading to detailed discussions or debates.
